>The Indian Ocean World is an arena that people, ideas and goods have criss-crossed to a staggering degree for millennia. 

>Many of these trajectories have passed through Lusail where Sheikh Jassim and his son traded pearls, leading to encounters with merchants from all over the world.  

>People move for many different reasons, compelled by curiosity, need and, at times, by passions and forces beyond their control. 

>Objects and ideas travel much further than people, and give us clues about past lives, behaviours and motivations. 

>In this gallery we investigate this world of breath-taking flux through a myriad of dynamic objects. Have a look at the digital tablets and labels for further information around types of materials, designs, technology and even games that have crossed land and sea. Exploring these displays, consider, what do they tell us about ourselves?
